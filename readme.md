# Official Inertia.js website.

Inertia is a new approach to building classic server-driven web apps.Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without much of the complexity.
Inertia isn't a framework, nor is it a replacement to your existing server-side or client-side frameworks. Rather, it's designed to work with them. Think of Inertia as glue that connects the two.
