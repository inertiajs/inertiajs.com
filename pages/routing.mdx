# Routing

## Defining routes

With Inertia all routing is defined server-side. Meaning you don't need Vue Router or React Router. Simply create routes using your server-side framework of choice.

## Generating URLs

Some server-side frameworks allow you to generate URLs from named routes. However, you will not have access to those helpers client-side. Here are a couple ways to still used named routes with Inertia.

The first option is to generate URLs server-side and include them as props. Notice in this example how we're passing the `edit_url` and `create_url` to the `Users` component.

```php
class UsersController
{
    public function index()
    {
        $users = User::get()->map(function ($user) {
            return [
                'id' => $user->id,
                'name' => $user->name,
                'email' => $user->email,
                'edit_url' => URL::route('users.edit', $user),
            ];
        });

        return Inertia::render('Users', [
            'users' => $users,
            'create_url' => URL::route('users.create'),
        ]);
    }
}
```

Another option is to make your route definitions available client-side as JSON, and then use this to generate URLs from your named routes.

```php
<script>
  let routes = {{ json_encode($routes) }}
</script>
```

If you're using Laravel, the <a href="https://github.com/tightenco/ziggy">Ziggy</a> library does this for you automatically via a global `route()` function. If you're using Ziggy with Vue.js, it's helpful to make this function available as a custom `$route` property so you can use it directly in your templates.

```js
Vue.prototype.$route = (...args) => route(...args).url()
```

```html
<inertia-link :href="$route('users.create')">Create User</inertia-link>
```
