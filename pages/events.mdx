# Events

Inertia provides an event system that allows you to "hook into" the various lifecycle events of the library.

## Registering listeners

To register an event listener, use the `Inertia.on()` method.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('start', (event) => {
  console.log(`Starting a visit to ${event.detail.visit.url}`)
})
```

Under the hood Inertia uses native browser events, so you can also work with them that way as well. Just be sure to append `inertia:` to the event name.

```js
document.addEventListener('inertia:start', (event) => {
  console.log(`Starting a visit to ${event.detail.visit.url}`)
})
```

## Removing listeners

When you register an event listener, Inertia automatically returns you a callback to remove the event listener.

```js
let removeStartEventListener = Inertia.on('start', (event) => {
  console.log(`Starting a visit to ${event.detail.visit.url}`)
})

// Remove the listener
removeStartEventListener()
```

Combined with a destroyed hook, you can automatically remove the event listener when you navigate to a different page.

```js
export default {
  mounted() {
    this.$once(
      'hook:destroyed',
      Inertia.on('start', (event) => {
        console.log(`Starting a visit to ${event.detail.visit.url}`)
      })
    )
  },
}
```

Alternatively, if you're using native browser events, you can remove the event listener using `removeEventListener()`.

```js
let startEventListener = (event) => {
  console.log(`Starting a visit to ${event.detail.visit.url}`)
}

document.addEventListener('inertia:start', startEventListener)

// Remove the listener
document.removeEventListener('inertia:start', startEventListener)
```

## Cancelling events

Some events (`start`, `invalid`, `error`) support cancellation, allowing you to prevent Inertia's default behaviour. Just like native events, if only one event listener calls `event.preventDefault()`, the event will be cancelled.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('start', (event) => {
  if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to navigate away?')) {
    event.preventDefault()
  }
})
```

As a convenience, if you register your event listener using `Inertia.on()`, you can also cancel the event by returning `false` from the listener.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('start', (event) => {
  return confirm('Are you sure you want to navigate away?')
})
```

## Before

The `before` event fires when a request is about to be made to the server. This is useful for intercepting visits.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('before', (event) => {
  console.log(`About to make a visit to ${event.detail.visit.url}`)
})
```

The primary purpose of this event is to allow you to prevent a visit from happening.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('before', (event) => {
  return confirm('Are you sure you want to navigate away?')
})
```

## Start

The `start` event fires when a request to the server has started. This is useful for displaying loading indicators.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('start', (event) => {
  console.log(`Starting a visit to ${event.detail.visit.url}`)
})
```

The `start` event is not cancelable.

## Progress

The `progress` event fires as progress increments during file uploads.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('progress', (event) => {
  this.form.progress = event.detail.progress.percentage
})
```

The `progress` event is not cancelable.

## Success

The `success` event fires on successful page visits. Note, this does _not_ include history visits.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('success', (event) => {
  console.log(`Successfully made a visit to ${event.detail.page.url}`)
})
```

The `success` event is not cancelable.

## Invalid

The `invalid` event fires when a non-Inertia response is received from the server, such as an `html` or `json` response. A valid Inertia response is one that has the `X-Inertia` header set to `true` with a `json` payload containing [the page object](/the-protocol#the-page-object).

This event is fired for all response types, including `200`, `400`, and `500` response codes.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('invalid', (event) => {
  console.log(`An invalid Inertia response was received.`)
  console.log(event.detail.response)
})
```

Cancel the `invalid` event to prevent Inertia from showing the non-Inertia response modal.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('invalid', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  // Handle the invalid response yourself
})
```

## Error

The `error` event fires on unexpected XHR errors, such as network interruptions, and for errors generated in the `resolveComponent()` callback.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('error', (event) => {
  console.log(`An unexpected error occurred during an Inertia visit.`)
  console.log(event.detail.error)
})
```

Cancel the `error` event to prevent the error from being thrown.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('error', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  // Handle the error yourself
})
```

Note, this event will _not_ fire for XHR requests that receive `400` and `500` level responses, or for non-Inertia responses, as these situations are handled in other ways by Inertia. See the [error handling](/error-handling) page for more information.

## Finish

The `finish` event fires after an XHR request has completed for both successful and unsuccessful responses. This event is useful for hiding loading indicators.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('finish', (event) => {
  NProgress.done()
})
```

The `finish` event is not cancelable.

## Navigate

The `navigate` event fires on successful page visits, as well as when navigating through history. This event is useful for tracking analytics and things of that nature.

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('navigate', (event) => {
  console.log(`Navigated to ${event.detail.page.url}`)
})
```

The `navigate` event is not cancelable.

## Event callbacks

In addition to the global events, Inertia also provides a number of [event callbacks](/manual-visits#event-callbacks) when manually making Inertia visits.
