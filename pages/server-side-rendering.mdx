# Server-side rendering

## Not supported

Inertia does not currently support server-side rendering. If that's a priority for your application, Inertia may not be the right choice for you. That said, we believe server-side rendering to be technically possible with Inertia, and are likely to revisit this in the future.

## Prerending services

Some Inertia users are successfully using services like [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io) and [Prerender.cloud](https://www.prerender.cloud) to generate and cache HTML versions of their Inertia websites, and then serve that content to bots for SEO purposes.

GitHub user [iksaku](https://gist.github.com/iksaku) has shared a middleware for using Prepender. You can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/iksaku/5efaede73f694942f3ea22af75a18c41).
