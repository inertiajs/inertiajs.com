# Server-side rendering

## Not supported

Inertia does not currently support server-side rendering. If that's a priority for your application, Inertia may not be the right choice for you. That said, we believe server-side rendering to be technically possible with Inertia, and are likely to revisit this in the future.

## Prerending services

Some Inertia users are successfully using services like [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io), [Prerender.cloud](https://www.prerender.cloud) and [Rendertron](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron) to generate and cache HTML versions of their Inertia websites, and then serve that content to bots for SEO purposes.
