# CSRF protection

## Making requests

If your web framework includes cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, you'll need to ensure that each Inertia requests includes the necessary token for `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests.

One solution is to include the CSRF token as a prop on every response. You can then use the token when making Inertia requests.

```js
this.$inertia.post('/users', {
  name: this.name,
  email: this.email,
  _token: this.$page.csrf_token,
})
```

You can even use the <a href="/shared-data">shared data</a> functionality to automatically include the `csrf_token` with each response.

However, a better approach is to use the CSRF functionality already built into [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for this. Axios is the HTTP library that Inertia uses under the hood.

Axios automatically checks for the existence of an `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. If it's present, it will then include the token in an `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header for any requests it makes.

The easiest way to implement this is using server-side middleware. Simply include the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie on each response, and then verify the token using the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header sent in the requests from axios.

Some frameworks, such as [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.8/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php#L176-L188), do this automatically, meaning there is no configuration required.

<Notice>
  If you're using Laravel, be sure to omit the <inlineCode class="bg-gray-600">csrf-token</inlineCode> meta tag from
  your project, as this will prevent the CSRF token from refreshing properly.

## Handling mismatches

When a CSRF token mismatch occurs, your web framework will likely throw an exception that results in an error response. For example, in Laravel a `TokenMismatchException` is thrown, which results in a `419` error page. Since that isn't a valid Inertia response, the error is shown in a modal.

  <source src="/mp4/csrf-mismatch-modal.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

But, this isn't a great user experience. A better way to handle these errors is to return a redirect back to the previous page, along with a flash message that the page expired. This will result in a valid Inertia response, with the flash message available as a prop, which you can then display to the user. Note, you'll need to share your [flash messages](/shared-data#flash-messages) with Inertia.js for this to work.

        use Throwable;
        use Inertia\\Inertia;\n
        /**
         * Prepare exception for rendering.
         *
         * @param  \\Throwable  $e
         * @return \\Throwable
         */
        public function render($request, Throwable $e)
        {
            $response = parent::render($request, $e);\n
            if ($response->status() === 419) {
                return back()->with([
                    'message' => 'The page expired, please try again.',
                ]);
            }\n
            return $response;
        }
      `,
    },
    {
      name: 'Rails',
      language: 'ruby',
      code: dedent`
        # todo
      `,
    },
  ]}
/>

The end result is a much better experience for your users. Instead of seeing the error modal, they are instead presented with a message that the "page expired", and are asked to try again.
