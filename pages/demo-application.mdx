# Demo application

We've setup a demo app for Inertia.js, called [Ping CRM](https://demo.inertiajs.com). This application is built using Laravel and Vue. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm).

<Notice>
  The Ping CRM demo is hosted on Heroku, and the database is reset every hour. Please be respectful when editing data.

</a>

In addition to the Vue version of Ping CRM, there is now also an officially maintained Svelte version of it, which you can find [here](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm-svelte).
