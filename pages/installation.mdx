# Installation

To use Inertia you need both a server-side adapter as well as a client-side adapter. Be sure to also follow the installation instructions for the frameworks you use.

## Official adapters

- [React](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-react)
- [Vue.js](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-vue)
- [Svelte](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-svelte)
- [Laravel](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-laravel)
- [Rails](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-rails)

## Server-side setup

The first step when using Inertia is to configure your server-side framework. This primarily includes setting up a root template and updating your endpoints to return Inertia responses. See the <a href="/server-side-setup">server-side setup</a> page for more details.

## Client-side setup

Once you have your server-side framework configured, you then need to setup your client-side framework. This primarily includes updating your main JavaScript file to boot the Inertia app. Please see the <a href="/client-side-setup">client-side setup</a> page for more details.
