# Responses

The magic of Inertia is in the server-side responses. When your app first loads, a full `html` page is returned. However, all subsequent page visits are done via `xhr`, with only `json` returned. This allows the single-page app functionality, since Inertia doesn't have to reboot the JavaScript framework on each page load.

## Creating responses

To create an Inertia response in your application, we recommend using one of our <a href="/server-side-setup">server-side adapters</a>.

In your controller, provide both the name of the JavaScript page component, as well as any props (data) for the page.

<TabbedCodeExamples
  examples={[
    {
      name: 'Laravel',
      language: 'php',
      code: dedent`
        use Inertia\Inertia;\n
        class EventsController extends Controller
        {
            public function show(Event $event)
            {
                return Inertia::render('Event/Show', [
                    'event' => $event->only(
                        'id',
                        'title',
                        'start_date',
                        'description'
                    ),
                ]);
            }
        }
      `,
    },
  ]}
/>

In this example we're passing a single prop, called `event`, which contains four attributes (`id`, `title`, `start_date` and `description`) to the `Event/Show` page component.

<Notice>
  To ensure that pages load quickly, only return the minimum data required for the page. Also, be aware that all data
  returned from the controllers will be visible client-side, so be sure to omit sensitive information.
</Notice>

## The page object

Inertia shares page data between the server and the front-end using a `page` object. This object includes the necessary information required to render the page component, update the history state, and track the application's asset version.

The `page` object includes four attributes:

1. **component**: The name of the JavaScript page component.
2. **props**: The page props (data).
3. **url**: The page url.
4. **version**: The current asset version.

## HTML responses

When an Inertia app first loads, a full `html` response is returned from the server. This includes your site assets in the `<head>` and a root `<div>` in the body.

The root `<div>` includes a `data-page` attribute with a `json` encoded version of the initial page object. Inertia uses this to boot your JavaScript application.

```twig
<html>
<head>
    <title>My app</title>
    <link href="/css/app.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <script src="/js/app.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>

<div id="app" data-page="{&quot;component&quot;:&quot;Event&quot;,&quot;props&quot;:{&quot;event&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:80,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Birthday party&quot;,&quot;start_date&quot;:&quot;2019-06-02&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Come out and celebrate Jonathan's 36th birthday party!&quot;}},&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/events/80&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;c32b8e4965f418ad16eaebba1d4e960f&quot;}"></div>

</body>
</html>
```

<Notice>
  While the initial page load is HTML, Inertia does not server-side render the JavaScript page component. It simply{' '}
  <inlineCode>json</inlineCode> encodes the page object into the root <inlineCode>&lt;div&gt;</inlineCode>, which is
  used to boot your JavaScript framework.
</Notice>

## XHR responses

Since Inertia is a framework for building single-page applications, all subsequent page visits are made as `xhr` requests.

Rather than returning a full `html` response on subsequent page visits, Inertia simply returns a `json` response of the page object. This `json` response is in the exact same format as the page object encoded in the initial `data-page` attribute.

```json
{
  "component": "Event",
  "props": {
    "event": {
      "id": 80,
      "title": "Birthday party",
      "start_date": "2019-06-02",
      "description": "Come out and celebrate Jonathan's 36th birthday party!"
    }
  },
  "url": "/events/80",
  "version": "c32b8e4965f418ad16eaebba1d4e960f"
}
```

All `xhr` responses have an `X-Inertia` header set to `true`. If you're creating your own server-side adapter, you can use this header to detect an Inertia response.

All `xhr` responses also include an `X-Inertia-Version` header used for auto refreshing assets. You can learn more about that on the [asset versioning](/asset-versioning) page.

Finally, all `xhr` responses have the `Vary` header set to `Accept`. This tells the browser that a page can be loaded in two different formats: `html` and `json`.
