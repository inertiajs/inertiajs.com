## Breaking changes

This release updates the `usePage()` hook to return the full `page` object, instead of just the page `props`. The purpose of this change is to better reflect what the [page object](https://inertiajs.com/the-protocol#the-page-object) is, and to make the other properties within the page object available to you, such as the `url`, `version` and `component` name. The upgrade path here is straightforwardâ€”simply append `.props` to all instances of then `page` object returned from `usePage()`.

This release also requires version `0.4.0` of the `@inertiajs/inertia` package. Please be sure to update your dependencies accordingly.
