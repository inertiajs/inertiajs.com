So yes, to answer your question, Inertia.js is now safe to use in production. ðŸŽ‰ Of course, we're still working toward a 1.0 release, and the API is subject to change. However, you can now lock in your dependency versions and use the library safely.

You'll need to update your applications. Please review the instructions below. You can also see an example of this update on the Ping CRM demo app [here](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm/commit/14352710ad577e45062a49d19a6a6d441e958fb6).

## 1. Update your JavaScript dependencies

First, you'll need to update your existing dependency to use the new NPM package name:

- `inertia/inertia-vue` becomes `@inertiajs/inertia-vue`
- `inertia/inertia-react` becomes `@inertiajs/inertia-react`

Be sure to lock these in at `^0.1.0`. For example:

```js
"@inertiajs/inertia-vue": "^0.1.0",
```

Second, you need to add `@inertiajs/inertia` as a dependency as well. It's no longer automatically included with the adapters.

```sh
npm install @inertiajs/inertia
```

## 2. Update your imports

We've removed all default exports and are now using named exports.

```js
// Before
import Inertia from 'inertia-vue'
import Inertia from 'inertia-react'

// After
import { InertiaApp } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue'
import { InertiaApp } from '@inertiajs/inertia-react'
```

If you're using Vue, you'll need to update the plugin:

```js
// Before
Vue.use(Inertia)

// After
Vue.use(InertiaApp)
```

If you were previously importing Inertia from one of the adapters, you now need to import that directly.

```js
// Before
import { Inertia } from 'inertia-vue'
import { Inertia } from 'inertia-react'

// After
import { Inertia } from 'inertia'
```

## 3. Update your PHP dependencies

If you are currently using the `inertiajs/inertia-laravel` adapter, be sure to set your version to `^0.1`. This library has now been tagged as well. Note, there were some breaking changes made recently to how `Inertia::share()` works.
