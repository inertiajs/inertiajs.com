- Added new `app` and `link` named exports, and have deprecated `InertiaApp` and `InertiaLink`.
- Added new `plugin` named export, and have deprecated using `InertiaApp` to register the plugin.
- Added the visit event callbacks to the `<inertia-link>` component ([#235](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/235)).
- Updated the `$page` property to return the full `page` object, instead of just the page `props`.
- Fixed issue where you couldn't access `this` in the `remember` callback ([#214](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/214)).
- [INTERNAL] Removed `transformProps()` call, since this is now now done in Inertia core.

## Breaking changes

This release updates the global `$page` property to return the full `page` object, instead of just the page `props`. The purpose of this change is to better reflect what the [page object](https://inertiajs.com/the-protocol#the-page-object) is, and to make the other properties within the page object available to you, such as the `url`, `version` and `component` name. The upgrade path here is straightforwardâ€”simply replace all instances of `$page` with `$page.props`.

This release also requires version `0.4.0` of the `@inertiajs/inertia` package. Please be sure to update your dependencies accordingly.
