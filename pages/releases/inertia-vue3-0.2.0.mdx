<h1>inertia-vue3@v0.2.0</h1>

<div className="-mt-8 mb-12 text-base font-medium text-gray-600">Published on October 20, 2020</div>

## Changes

- Add Inertia link `as` option to render the component as a different element ([#271](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/271)).
- Update Inertia link `preserveState` default to be based on the method ([#263](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/263)).
- Update Inertia link to merge data into the URL query string (`href`) for `GET` requests ([#264](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/264)).

## Deprecations

Inertia now shows a console warning if you create an Inertia link that uses a method other than `GET` and you also don't change the link element to something other than an `<a>` tag. This is due to accessibility issues that come with using anchor links for non-GET requests, which you can read more about here: #268.

To hide this console warning, use the new `as` option to set a more appropriate element, such as a `<button>`. For example:

```diff
- <inertia-link href="/logout" method="post">Logout</inertia-link>
+ <inertia-link href="/logout" method="post" as="button" type="button">Logout</inertia-link>
```

## Breaking changes

This release depends on changes made to the internals of Inertia, which requires updating `@inertiajs/inertia` to `^0.5.0`. The peer dependencies have been updated to reflect this.
