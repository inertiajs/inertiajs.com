This release adds the ability to define "lazy props". ([#175](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-laravel/pull/175))

Lazy props are data that's not included on the initial visit to a page. These properties only get included on partial reloads, using the `only` option. This is useful for "expensive" data, such as requests to 3rd party APIs, that are not needed on the initial visit to a page.

You can mark a prop as lazy using the new `Inertia::lazy()` method:

```php
return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
    'users' => User::paginate('id', 'name', 'email'),
    'companies' => Inertia::lazy(fn () => Company::get('id', 'name')),
]);
```

Then, to load this prop later on, you perform a partial reload from your page component, either using a link:

```js
<inertia-link class="hover:underline" href="/users" :only="['companies']">Load companies</inertia-link>
```

Or by doing this programatically:

```js
Inertia.reload({ only: ['companies'] })
```
