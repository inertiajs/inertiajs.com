## Changes

- Update Inertia link `preserveState` default to be based on the method ([#263](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/263)).
- Update Inertia link to merge data into the URL query string (`href`) for `GET` requests ([#264](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/264)).

## Deprecations

Inertia now shows a console warning if you create an Inertia link that uses a method other than `GET`. This is due to accessibility issues that come with using anchor links for non-GET requests, which you can read more about here: #268.

To hide this console warning, use the `inertia` directive instead to set a more appropriate element, such as a `<button>`. For example:

```diff
- <InertiaLink href="/logout" method="post">Logout</InertiaLink>
+ <button use:inertia={{ method: 'post', href: '/logout' }} type="button">Logout</button>
```

## Breaking changes

This release depends on changes made to the internals of Inertia, which requires updating `@inertiajs/inertia` to `^0.5.0`. The peer dependencies have been updated to reflect this.
