## Global events

This release adds a new event system to Inertia.js, allowing developers to "hook into" the various lifecycle events of the library. Here's how to use it:

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

Inertia.on('start', (event) => {
  console.log(`Starting a visit to ${event.detail.visit.url}`)
})
```

When you register an event, Inertia automatically returns you a callback to unregister the event. Combined with a destroyed hook, you can do something like this to automatically unregister the event when you navigate to a different page.

```js
export default {
  mounted() {
    this.$once(
      'hook:destroyed',
      Inertia.on('start', (event) => {
        if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to navigate away?')) {
          event.preventDefault()
        }
      })
    )
  },
}
```

Under the hood this uses native browser events, so you can also work with them that way. For example:

```js
document.addEventListener('inertia:start', (event) => {
  console.log(`starting a visit to ${event.detail.visit.url}`)
})
```

Some events support cancellation, allowing you to prevent Inertia's default behaviour. Just like native events, if only one event listener calls `event.preventDefault()`, the event will be cancelled.

Here is a complete list of all the available events:

| Name       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Detail              | Cancelable                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `start`    | Fires before a request is made to the server. Useful for displaying loading indicators and for listening to and intercepting visits.                                                                                                                                                                   | `e.detail.visit`    | Yes, prevents visit from being made.       |
| `progress` | Fires whenever a progress event is emitted during a file upload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `e.detail.progress` | No                                         |
| `success`  | Fires on successful page visits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `e.detail.page`     | No                                         |
| `invalid`  | Fires when a non-Inertia response is received, for all response levels (200, 400 and 500).                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `e.detail.response` | Yes, prevents the modal from being shown.  |
| `error`    | Fires on unexpected XHR errors (such as network interruptions) and for errors generated in the `resolveComponent()` callback. Will NOT fire for XHR requests that receive a response (even if they are 400/500 level responses).                                                                       | `e.detail.error`    | Yes, prevents the error from being thrown. |
| `finish`   | Fires after an XHR request is made to the server, for both successful and unsuccessful responses. Useful for hiding loading indicators.                                                                                                                                                                | N/A                 | No                                         |
| `navigate` | Fires when a new state is pushed into the history (initial visit and on `history.pushState`), or when navigating history (`popstate`). Does not fire for `history.replaceState` events. These are considered "successful" page navigation events, useful for tracking analytics, and things like that. | `e.detail.page`     | No                                         |

## Event callbacks

In addition to the global events, this release adds a number of visit event callbacks.

```js
Inertia.post('/users', data, {
  onCancelToken: (cancelToken) => {},
  onCancel: (visit) => {},
  onStart: (visit) => {},
  onProgress: (progress) => {},
  onSuccess: (page) => {},
  onFinish: () => {},
})
```

## Visit promise deprecated

This release deprecates the promise that is returned from `Inertia.visit()`. If you call `then()`, `catch()` or `finally()` on an Inertia visit, you'll get the following warning:

> Inertia.js visit promises have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use the new visit event callbacks instead.
>
> Learn more at https://inertiajs.com/events

The recommended approach is to use the new event callbacks instead. For example, instead of using `then()`, use `onSuccess()`:

```js
Inertia.post('/profile', data, {
  onSuccess: () => {
    if (this.errors.isEmpty()) {
      this.form.password = null
    }
  },
})
```

And, instead of using `finally()`, use `onFinish()` instead:

```js
Inertia.post('/profile', data, {
  onFinish: () => (this.sending = false),
})
```

## NProgress removed (breaking change)

This PR removes the direct NProgress integration, since the new event system makes this so easy to do outside of Inertia core. This behaviour is now available via a first-class package called [@inertiajs/progress](https://github.com/inertiajs/progress).

To add the new progress library to your project, first install the package:

```bash
npm install @inertiajs/progress
yarn add @inertiajs/progress
```

Once it's been installed, initialize it in your app:

```js
import { InertiaProgress } from '@inertiajs/progress'

InertiaProgress.init({
  // The delay after which the progress bar will
  // appear during navigation, in milliseconds.
  delay: 250,

  // The color of the progress bar.
  color: '#29d',

  // Whether to include the default NProgress styles.
  includeCSS: true,

  // Whether the NProgress spinner will be shown.
  showSpinner: false,
})
```

## Other changes

- Restored lazy evaluation of `preserveScroll` and `preserveState` ([#231](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/231)).
- Scroll region improvements (refactored to a single scroll event listener).
