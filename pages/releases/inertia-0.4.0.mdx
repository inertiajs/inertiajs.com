- Updated plain JSON response message in modal.
- [INTERNAL] Updated to now call `transformProps()`, since this behaviour has been removed from the adapters.
- [INTERNAL] Updated the `updatePage()` callback be called `swapComponent()`, and changed arguments order.
- Fixed the TypeScript definitions.
- Fixed bug where partial reload props would get merged when the page component changed.

## Breaking change
