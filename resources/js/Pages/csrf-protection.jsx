      <Notice>
        Laravel automatically includes the proper CSRF token when making requests via Inertia or Axios. However, if
        you're using Laravel, be sure to omit the <Code color="orange">csrf-token</Code> meta tag from your project, as
        this will prevent the CSRF token from refreshing properly.
      </Notice>
      <P>
        If your server-side framework includes cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, you'll need to ensure that
        each Inertia requests includes the necessary CSRF token for <Code>POST</Code>, <Code>PUT</Code>,{' '}
        <Code>PATCH</Code>, and <Code>DELETE</Code> requests.
      </P>
      <P>
        Of course, as already discussed, some server-side frameworks such as Laravel automatically handle the inclusion
        of the CSRF token when making requests.{' '}
        <strong>Therefore, no additional configuration is required when using one of these frameworks.</strong>
      </P>
      <P>
        However, if you need to handle CSRF protection manually, one approach is to include the CSRF token as a prop on
        every response. You can then use the token when making Inertia requests.

      <P>
        You can even use Inertia's <A href="/shared-data">shared data</A> functionality to automatically include the{' '}
        <Code>csrf_token</Code> with each response.
      </P>
      <P>
        However, a better approach is to use the CSRF functionality already built into{' '}
        <A href="https://github.com/axios/axios">axios</A> for this. Axios is the HTTP library that Inertia uses under
        the hood.
      </P>
      <P>
        Axios automatically checks for the existence of an <Code>XSRF-TOKEN</Code> cookie. If it's present, it will then
        include the token in an <Code>X-XSRF-TOKEN</Code> header for any requests it makes.
      </P>
      <P>
        The easiest way to implement this is using server-side middleware. Simply include the <Code>XSRF-TOKEN</Code>{' '}
        cookie on each response, and then verify the token using the <Code>X-XSRF-TOKEN</Code> header sent in the
        requests from axios.
      </P>
      <H2>Handling mismatches</H2>
      <P>
        When a CSRF token mismatch occurs, your server-side framework will likely throw an exception that results in an
        error response. For example, when using Laravel, a <Code>TokenMismatchException</Code> is thrown which results
        in a <Code>419</Code> error page. Since that isn't a valid Inertia response, the error is shown in a modal.
      </P>
      <video controls>
        <source src="/mp4/csrf-mismatch-modal.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
      <P>
        Obviously, this isn't a great user experience. A better way to handle these errors is to return a redirect back
        to the previous page, along with a flash message that the page expired. This will result in a valid Inertia
        response with the flash message available as a prop which you can then display to the user. Of course, you'll
        need to share your <A href="/shared-data#flash-messages">flash messages</A> with Inertia for this to work.
      </P>
      <P>
        When using Laravel, you may modify your application's exception handler to automatically redirect the user back
        to the page they were previously on while flashing a message to the session. To accomplish this, you may use the
        <Code>respond</Code> exception method in your application's <Code>bootstrap/app.php</Code> file.

      <P>
        The end result is a much better experience for your users. Instead of seeing the error modal, the user is
        instead presented with a message that the page "expired" and are asked to try again.
