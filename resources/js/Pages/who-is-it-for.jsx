        Inertia was designed for development teams and solo hackers who typically build server-side rendered
        applications using frameworks like Laravel, Ruby on Rails or Django. They create controllers, get data from the
        database (via an ORM), and render views.
      </P>
      <P>
        But what happens when these developers want to replace their server-side rendered views with a modern
        JavaScript-based single-page application front-end? The answer is always "you need to build an API". Because
        that's how modern SPAs are built.

        This means building a REST or GraphQL API. It means figuring out authentication and authorization for that API.
        It means client-side state management. It means setting up a new Git repository. It means a more complicated
        deployment strategy. And this list goes on. It's a complete paradigm shift.

          Inertia allows you to build a fully JavaScript-based single-page application without any of the added
          complexity.

      <P>
        Inertia works much more like a classic server-side rendered application. You create controllers, you get data
        from the database (via your ORM), and you render views. But, Inertia views are JavaScript page components
        written in React, Vue, or Svelte.
      </P>
      <P>
        This means you get all the power of a client-side application and modern SPA experience, but you don't need to
        build an API. We think it's a breath of fresh air that will supercharge your productivity.
