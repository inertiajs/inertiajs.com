      <P>Inertia is a new approach to building classic server-driven web apps. We call it the modern monolith.</P>
      <P>
        Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without the complexity that comes
        with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side patterns that you already love.
      </P>
      <P>
        Inertia has no client-side routing, nor does it require an API. Simply build controllers and page views like
        you've always done! Inertia works great with any backend framework, but it's fine-tuned for{' '}

      </P>
      <H2>Not a framework</H2>
      <P>
        Inertia isn't a framework, nor is it a replacement for your existing server-side or client-side frameworks.
        Rather, it's designed to work with them. Think of Inertia as glue that connects the two. Inertia does this via
        adapters. We currently have three official client-side adapters (React, Vue, and Svelte) and three server-side
        adapters (Laravel, Rails, and Phoenix).
